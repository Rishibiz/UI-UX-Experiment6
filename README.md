# UI-UX-Experiment6

## Aim:

To practice solution ideation, user story creation, scenario development, flow mapping, and information architecture design to improve user experience through structured UX design activities.

## Algorithm:

Select a Known UX Problem for Ideation

Conduct Crazy 8s or Brainwriting to Generate Multiple Low-Fidelity Ideas

Use Personas and Goals to Write at Least Five User Stories

Select One User Story and Develop a Detailed Narrative Scenario

Choose a Task and Create a Task Flow Diagram Using Standard Symbols

Select an Example Website or App for Information Architecture Analysis

Conduct Card Sorting (Open or Closed) to Categorize Content

Create a Site Map Reflecting the Categorized Structure

## Output:

 1. Solution Ideation
UX Problem: Booking an Appointment in a Hospital App
Method: Crazy 8s Ideation Exercise
I conducted a "Crazy 8s" ideation session to rapidly sketch 8 different low-fidelity ideas for
solving this problem within 8 minutes.
Key Ideas Sketched:
1. Quick Book Button: One-tap appointment booking for returning patients.
2. Smart Calendar Sync: Shows available dates based on patient and doctor availability.
3. Specialty Search Filter: Filter doctors by department (e.g., cardiology, dermatology).
4. Doctor Preview Cards: Mini bios, ratings, and next available slots.
5. Voice Booking: Allow users to book appointments via voice assistant.
6. Emergency Booking Shortcut: Immediate booking with nearest available doctor.
7. Chat with Receptionist: Live chat to help with booking or changes.
8. Health Record Integration: Pulls in past visit data to recommend follow-ups.
 2. Creating User Stories
Using personas (like an elderly patient, a busy professional, or a concerned parent), here are 5
user stories:
1. As a returning patient, I want to quickly rebook my last appointment, so that I don’t
have to search all over again.
2. As a working professional, I want to find doctors available after work hours, so that I
can visit without taking leave.
3. As a new user, I want to search for doctors by specialty, so that I can find the right type
of medical help.
4. As a parent, I want to book pediatric appointments for my child, so that their health
issues are properly addressed.
5. As an elderly patient, I want to use voice commands to book appointments, so that I
don’t struggle with small text.
 3. Creating Scenarios
Selected User Story:
As a working professional, I want to find doctors available after work hours, so that I can
visit without taking leave.
Scenario:
Name: Anjali, 32
Occupation: Marketing Manager
Environment: She’s at work, glancing at her phone during a lunch break.
Emotional State: Frustrated and anxious due to recurring migraines, but short on time.
Task: Book an appointment with a neurologist after 6 PM on a weekday.
Narrative:
Anjali has been experiencing frequent migraines and needs to consult a neurologist. She's busy
with meetings all day and can only check her phone briefly. During her break, she opens the
hospital app, uses the specialty filter to search for a neurologist, and adds a time filter to only
show doctors available after 6 PM. The app shows 3 matches with bios and ratings. She selects
Dr. Mehta, checks the available slots, and books for Wednesday at 7 PM. The app sends a
confirmation and allows her to add the appointment to her calendar.
 4. Flow Diagrams / Flow Mapping
Task: Booking an Appointment via App

 5. Information Architecture (IA)
Example App: Hospital Appointment App
Card Sorting Exercise (Open Sort):
Conducted a card sorting with 5 participants. Items included:
• Book Appointment
• View Test Reports
• Contact Doctor
• Emergency Help
• Chat Support
• My Prescriptions
• Billing & Payments
• Edit Profile
• Past Appointments
Resulting Categories:

## Result:

Hence, multiple design ideas were generated through ideation exercises, clear user stories and rich scenarios were developed to capture user context, detailed flow diagrams mapped user tasks effectively, and an organized site map was created using card sorting. This comprehensive process enhances understanding of user needs and optimizes UX design.
